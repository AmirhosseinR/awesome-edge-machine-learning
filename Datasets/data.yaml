  description: >
     Visual Wake Words represents a common microcontroller vision use-case of identifying whether a person is present in the image or not, and provides a realistic benchmark for tiny vision models. Within a limited memory footprint of 250 KB, several state-of-the-art mobile models achieve accuracy of 85-90% on the Visual Wake Words dataset.
